# Healthcare-Claims-Data-Engineering
This project implements an end-to-end data engineering solution in Microsoft Fabric to process and analyze healthcare insurance claims. Using a Medallion Architecture, the pipeline transforms raw, unstructured claim files into a refined dimensional model, enabling stakeholders to track financial performance, and claim denial patterns.
